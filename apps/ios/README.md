# MILO for iPhone

Native SwiftUI implementation of MILO, with current visual and motion comparison against the actual Web product: mood and descriptor rings, present/past memory journeys, offline guidance, diary editing, collection/detail, two card templates, local account entry and AI settings.

**Full cross-platform acceptance is still in progress.** Current scope, actual results and external blockers are in [PARITY-STATUS.md](PARITY-STATUS.md). The source-bound 53-case screenshot ledger and comparison contract are in [the visual parity documentation](../../docs/visual-parity/README.md).

Open `Milo.xcodeproj` with Xcode and an iPhone simulator. Minimum deployment is iOS 17; Swift 6.1+ is required by the portable test package. Use the **Milo** scheme. The local owner entry is `milo`. The supported AGConnect iOS provider is integrated; remote login still requires the bundle-matching service configuration and actual service verification. Synthetic screenshot identities never count as remote authentication.

```sh
# Run from repository root
npm ci --prefix apps/ios --ignore-scripts
xcodegen generate --spec apps/ios/project.yml
swift test --package-path apps/ios/MiloCore
apps/ios/scripts/test-journal-ai.sh
node --test apps/ios/tests/parity-evidence.test.mjs
node --test apps/ios/tests/web-parity-gate.test.mjs
# Existing local iteration: resume its saved state; do not initialize again.
node .agents/skills/specdrive/scripts/specdrive.mjs status .specdrive/web-native-20260929
# User-authorized stability continuation; preserve its saved attempts.
node .agents/skills/specdrive/scripts/specdrive.mjs status .specdrive/stability-20260930
# For a genuinely new authorized phase, initialize specdrive.web-native.json once.
# Keep its returned state directory for every repair resume.
```

The app keeps device-local records and atomic JSON drafts in Application Support. Schema 1 remains readable and migrates on successful writes; unknown future or corrupted data blocks rewriting. Personal API keys are bound to account/provider/HTTPS destination in Keychain and excluded from exports. Every AI failure has a local fallback.

`specdrive.stability.json` verifies Xcode simulator signing, the compiled AppIcon, data-preserving installation, native Keychain, repeated launches, account journeys, journal journeys, motion and all 53 native capture cases. The [stability plan](../../docs/operations/ios-stability-plan-2026-09-30.md) defines the repair and review bounds. Simulator builds use Xcode's normal signing; do not manually attach device-only entitlements to a host ad-hoc signature. The installer backs up and compares existing persisted files before replacing the app without uninstalling it.

`specdrive.web-native.json` preserves the Web-reference phase; `specdrive.parity.json` preserves the historical Harmony-reference phase. Missing screenshot pairs or actual remote account verification blocks final acceptance. The previous `specdrive.config.json`, `verify.mjs` and pilot reports document the earlier offline slice; their six screenshots cannot approve the expanded product.

The portable package pins Apple's Swift Testing only for tests; its production domain model has no third-party runtime dependency. The iOS account adapter links the pinned AGConnect SDK. Original HarmonyOS mood artwork is reused byte-for-byte. Source assets, implementation, project configuration, tests and verification scripts are fingerprinted alongside actual builds; never copy a passing receipt onto changed code.

Raw `.xcresult` bundles, simulator stores and signing/service credentials stay local or in controlled CI artifacts. Do not publish personal diary data.
